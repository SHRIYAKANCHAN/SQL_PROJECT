INTRODUCTION

This project dedicated to analyzing Pizza Hut sales data using SQL. In this project, we delve into the rich dataset provided
by Pizza Hut to uncover valuable insights into customer preferences, sales trends, and operational efficiency. Analyzing Pizza 
Hut sales data using SQL can provide a wealth of insights into various aspects of the business. 

OBJECTIVE

 Our primary objective is to utilize SQL queries to extract, transform, and analyze Pizza Hut's sales data.The primary goal 
 of this project is to analyze Pizza Hut's sales data to uncover valuable insights into customer preferences, sales trends,
 and operational efficiency. By leveraging SQL, we aim to process, query, and analyze the data to support data-driven 
 decision-making for the business.

DATASET

 The dataset provided by Pizza Hut includes a comprehensive collection of sales records, customer information, product details,
 and transactional data. This data encompasses various dimensions such as time, geography, customer demographics, and product categories.

QUESTIONS THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS
 
 1. Retrieve the total number of orders placed.
 2. Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
 3. Identify the highest-priced pizza.
 4. Identify the most common pizza size ordered.
 5. List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.
 6. Find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
 7. Find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.
 8. Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.
 9. Find total revenue for each pizza category

METHODODLOGY

The raw data for analysis is spread across multiple files. Using Excel, these files are first merged into a single dataset. 
During this process, it becomes evident that many of the files and columns are irrelevant to the analysis. After merging
the files, a new Excel sheet is created, containing only clean, relevant data, free of duplicates and unnecessary columns. 
This consolidated and refined dataset forms the basis for the analysis. Subsequently, SQL is used to write queries that 
address the key questions. Analyzing the data in SQL helps uncover various insights and patterns that inform the analysis.

INSIGHTS

The total number of orders placed is 41, generating a total revenue of 3585 Rs in a day. 
The highest priced pizza is the BBQ Chicken Pizza, which costs 20.75 Rs. 
The most common pizza orders are of large and small sizes, with 19 large orders and 22 small orders. 
The top most ordered pizzas by quantity are BBQ Chicken Pizza, California Chicken Pizza, Big Meat Pizza, Hawaiian Pizza, and Calibri Pizza. 
The total quantities ordered for each pizza category are 15 Supreme, 105 Classic, 3 Veggies, and 108 Chicken.
In terms of revenue, Big Meat Pizza generated 1118.5 Rs, BBQ Chicken Pizza generated 1008 Rs, and California Chicken Pizza generated 673 Rs.
